## Red Flags & Pivot Triggers

### Week 2 Red Flags

**If you see:**
- <15 active tokens (streamer demand weak)
- <$100K volume (trader demand weak)
- <15% wallet connection rate (UX problem)
- <20% first trade rate (activation problem)

**Then:**
- Pause new streamer recruitment
- Focus on fixing conversion funnel
- Talk to 20 users (what's broken?)
- Iterate rapidly

### Week 4 Red Flags

**If you see:**
- Flat or declining week-over-week growth
- <10% new signups from referrals (viral loops not working)
- High churn (users trade once and leave)
- Low engagement (no one in Discord, no Twitter mentions)

**Then:**
- Double down on retention (why are people leaving?)
- Fix viral loops (test new incentives)
- Increase content frequency (stay top-of-mind)
- Consider pivot (maybe model is broken)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Shiny Object Syndrome
- **Don't:** Chase every new channel, tactic, idea
- **Do:** Pick 2-3 channels, master them, then expand

### 2. Vanity Metrics
- **Don't:** Obsess over Twitter followers, Discord members
- **Do:** Focus on volume, trades, revenue (things that matter)

### 3. Premature Scaling
- **Don't:** Spend big on ads before finding product-market fit
- **Do:** Start organic, test small, scale what works

### 4. Ignoring Data
- **Don't:** Go with gut feel over evidence
- **Do:** Let experiments guide decisions

### 5. Burning Out
- **Don't:** Work 100 hours/week (unsustainable)
- **Do:** Prioritize ruthlessly, delegate, take breaks
