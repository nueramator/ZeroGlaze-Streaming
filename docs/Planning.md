What am I actually trying to do? (What are the goals for this project?) - 

I want to make a full fledged app to be profitable and make me money. I am trying to build an extension that allows streamers from any platform to connect their streams directly to a "coin/token". I want small streamers to have the ability to launch their own token for streaming without being restraint on speciifc streaming websites and thus allowing them to start making money from streaming even as a baby streamer. I would want to allow meme coin traders to actually think through and get entertained whenever they are trading so they can enjoy while making money as if they are almost "betting" on the streamer's success. I would want thousands of people constantly on my site where they will be linking thier streams to coins and multiple people trade coins based on them. 

What are the milestones of functionality that I want? -

MVP:

- User can link my twitch stream to a coin.
- The App Should Know Whenever Streamer Is Streaming Or If They Ended Stream
- The Launchpad Should Be Able To Launch An Actual Token Supported Through The Solana Blockchain
- Creator of stream should be able to access their share holdings of the tokens (if they bought any) through their Phantom wallet
- On Devnet, Traders are able to buy and sell these tokens and in real time the market cap of the tokens should change as per bonding curve
- Creator should automatically recieve a percentage of platform fees that the platfomr makes (us) from the fees that the traders give for trading on our site
- Make sure tokens are linked to streamer accounts, not individual streams so one guy can't make more than one token forever
- Everything is in real time and smooth
 
v1:

- Integration to other live streaming platforms
- The site for the app should look clean and techy and should be consumer friendly
- Design of the website should captivate traders and give incentives to keep spending their money on the platform
- There should be a live trading view graph for every token for traders to accurately see dev buys and sells along with their own buy and sells

v2:

- An automatic pop up should show on top of every stream connected to our app (NAME OF APP IS ZEROGLAZE) and should show an overlay on streamer's stream showing market cap.
- Measures should be taken to make sure each person is only able to launch one token no matter if they are accessing from a diffrent phantom wallet
- The app should hold security features and be extremely safe for our visitors
- There should be absolutely no leaks in the holding of our data along withe visitors
- The site is polished and ready for publication

Later:

- A KYC feature that would make some creators "verified" and thus reducing risk of them going ghost mode

Not In Scope:

- Hosting the streams on our site
- Live showing streams on our site (we only offer the link to the stream)
