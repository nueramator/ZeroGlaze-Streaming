## Phase 2: Viral Loop Engineering (Week 5-8)

### Core Viral Loops

**Loop 1: Streamer → Trader → Discovery**

```
Streamer launches token
    ↓
Announces to 500-person community
    ↓
50 fans buy token (10% conversion)
    ↓
Fans explore platform, discover other tokens
    ↓
30% try trading another token (15 new traders per streamer)
    ↓
1 trader becomes regular (visits 3+ times/week)
    ↓
Regular trader refers friend (0.5 referrals/trader)
```

**Viral Coefficient Formula:**
- Each streamer brings 50 initial traders
- Each trader refers 0.5 traders = 25 more traders
- Total: 75 traders per streamer
- If 1 in 75 becomes a streamer: K = 1.0 (sustainable viral growth)

**Loop 2: Win → Share → FOMO**

```
Trader makes 5x on token
    ↓
Auto-generated shareable graphic: "I just 5x'd on $STREAMERNAME"
    ↓
Posts to Twitter/Discord (30% share rate)
    ↓
Followers see win, experience FOMO
    ↓
10% click through to platform
    ↓
50% connect wallet, 30% make first trade
```

**Loop 3: Leaderboard Competition**

```
Platform shows "Top Gainers Today" leaderboard
    ↓
Streamers compete to rank higher
    ↓
Promote more actively to drive token price
    ↓
Attract more traders to their token
    ↓
Higher volume = higher platform visibility
    ↓
Featured placement attracts new traders
```

### 5. Referral Program Deep Dive

**Economics:**

Standard platform fee: 1% per trade

**Referral split:**
- Platform: 0.9%
- Referrer: 0.1%

**Example:**
- You refer 10 active traders
- Each trades $10K/month average
- Total monthly volume from your referrals: $100K
- Your monthly passive income: $100 (0.1% × $100K)
- Your yearly income: $1,200 (from just 10 referrals!)

**Power User Math:**
- Refer 100 active traders: $1,000/month passive
- Refer 1,000 active traders: $10,000/month passive
- Top referrer potential: $50K+/month (if they bring streamers who bring traders)

**Referral Tiers:**

| Tier | Referrals | Bonus | Reward |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Starter | 1-9 | - | Standard 0.1% |
| Builder | 10-49 | +0.02% | Total 0.12% |
| Growth | 50-99 | +0.05% | Total 0.15% |
| Elite | 100-499 | +0.08% | Total 0.18% |
| Legend | 500+ | +0.12% | Total 0.22% |

**Tools Provided:**

1. **Referral Dashboard**
   - Total referred (all-time)
   - Active referrals (traded in last 30 days)

Hey [Name],

I'm building Zeroglaze - a platform where streamers launch tradeable tokens on Solana. We've done $500K volume in our first 2 weeks with 50 active tokens.

I think [Partner] + Zeroglaze could unlock [specific value]:
- [Benefit to their users]
- [Benefit to their metrics]
- [Unique angle]

Would you be open to a 15-min call to explore?

[Founder name]
```

**Meeting pitch:**
1. What we've built (2 min)
2. Traction metrics (1 min)
3. How partnership benefits them (5 min)
4. What we're asking (2 min)

- Build undeniable traction
- Use success to pitch Twitch in Month 6-12

---

### Crypto Exchange Partnerships (Token Graduation)

**Graduation Path:**

When a token hits $1M market cap + $500K volume:
1. Notify streamer: "Your token qualified for graduation!"
2. Migrate to Jupiter/Raydium liquidity pools
3. List on centralized exchanges (if demand)

**Target Exchanges:**

1. **MEXC** (Tier 2 CEX)
   - Listing cost: $10K-50K (negotiable)
   - Benefit: Legitimacy, more liquidity, broader audience
   - Requirement: Proven volume + community

2. **Gate.io** (Tier 2 CEX)
   - Similar to MEXC
   - More Asian exposure

3. **Coinbase** (Tier 1, aspirational)
   - Only for tokens with strong fundamentals
   - Likely 6-12 months out
   - Need: Compliance, legal structure, massive volume

**Partnership approach:**
- Negotiate bulk listing deals (10 tokens for price of 3)
- Revenue share: Exchange gets % of graduated token fees
- Co-marketing: Feature streamers on exchange platforms

**Timeline:**
- Month 3: First token hits graduation criteria
- Month 4: First DEX migration (Jupiter/Raydium)
- Month 6: First CEX listing (MEXC or Gate)

**Hypothesis:** Shorter onboarding reduces drop-off

**Variants:**
- Control: 4 steps (Connect → Profile → Tutorial → Trade)
- A: 2 steps (Connect → Trade with inline tooltips)
- B: 3 steps (Connect → Quick tutorial → Trade)

**Primary metric:** First trade completion rate
**Secondary metric:** Time to first trade

**Expected outcome:** Variant A wins with 40% first trade rate (vs 30% control)

---

**Experiment 3: First Trade Incentive (Week 4)**

**Hypothesis:** Higher incentive drives more first trades, but need to find optimal point

**Variants:**
- Control: No incentive

- B: $5 credit after first trade (min 0.1 SOL)
- C: $10 credit after first trade (min 0.2 SOL)

**Primary metric:** First trade rate
**Secondary metric:** CAC and LTV (ensure economics work)

**Expected outcome:**
- Variant B: 45% first trade rate, $8 CAC
- Variant C: 50% first trade rate, $15 CAC
- Choose B if LTV > $40, choose C if LTV > $80

---

**Experiment 4: Homepage Hero Focus (Week 5)**

**Hypothesis:** Trader-focused messaging converts better (larger audience)

**Variants:**
- Control: 50/50 split (left = streamer, right = trader)
- A: Trader-focused ("Find the next 100x streamer token")
- B: Streamer-focused ("Turn your stream into a tradeable asset")
- C: Platform-focused ("The streaming economy, tokenized")

**Segment by traffic source:**
- Crypto Twitter traffic → Likely traders → Should prefer A
- TikTok traffic → Likely streamers → Should prefer B

**Primary metric:** Wallet connection rate by segment
**Secondary metric:** First action (launch token vs trade)

---

### Retention Experiments

**Goal:** Increase Day 1 → Day 7 retention from 30% → 45%

**Experiment 5: Email Drip Campaign (Week 6)**

**Hypothesis:** Timely emails bring users back

**Variants:**
- Control: No emails
- A: 3-email sequence (Day 1, 3, 6)
- B: 5-email sequence (Day 1, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- C: Personalized sequence (based on first action)

**Email content:**
- Day 1: "Welcome! Here's what to do first"
- Day 2: "Did you see [Top performing token today]?"
- Day 3: "Your first trade earned you $X - here's what's next"
- Day 4: "Top traders' secrets to finding 10x tokens"
- Day 6: "We miss you! Here's $5 to come back"

**Primary metric:** Day 7 return rate

- B: Real-time alerts (tokens you hold, streamers you follow)
- C: Personalized mix (algorithm decides what's relevant)

**Content examples:**
- "$STREAMER just went live - their token is up 20%"
- "Your token just hit a new ATH!"
- "3 new tokens launched in your favorite category"

**Primary metric:** Day 1 → 7 → 30 retention
**Expected outcome:** Variant C → 50% D7, 30% D30

---

**Experiment 7: Referral Modal Timing (Week 7)**

**Hypothesis:** Asking for referrals after positive experience increases sharing

**Variants:**
- Control: Referral link always visible in profile
- A: Modal immediately after wallet connect
- B: Modal after first profitable trade (>10% gain)
- C: Modal after 3rd trade (engagement proven)

**Primary metric:** % of users who share referral link
**Expected outcome:** Variant B → 25% share rate (emotional high of winning)

---

### Growth Model Experiments

**Experiment 8: Streamer Incentive Structure (Week 9)**

**Hypothesis:** Performance-based bonuses scale better than upfront payments

**Variants:**
- Control: $50 upfront to all streamers
- A: $25 upfront + $25 after $25K volume
- B: $0 upfront + $100 after $50K volume
- C: Tiered: $10K vol = $25, $25K = $50, $50K = $100

**Primary metric:**
- Cost per $100K volume generated
- Streamer quality (avg volume per streamer)

**Expected outcome:** Variant C attracts serious streamers, filters out tourists

---

**Experiment 9: Trader Acquisition Channel Mix (Week 10-12)**

---

## Success Criteria

### Must-Hit Metrics (Make or Break)

**Day 30:**
- 50+ active tokens (proof of streamer demand)
- $500K+ weekly volume (proof of trader demand)
- 30%+ D7 retention (proof of product value)
- Viral coefficient > 0.5 (path to organic growth)

**Day 60:**
- 150+ active tokens
- $2M+ weekly volume
- 35%+ D7 retention
- Viral coefficient > 0.8

**Day 90:**
- 300+ active tokens
- $4M+ weekly volume
- 40%+ D7 retention
- Viral coefficient > 1.0 (sustainable organic growth)

### Leading Indicators (Early Warnings)

**Green Flags:**
- Organic streamer applications (not just incentive-driven)
- Traders holding multiple tokens (platform stickiness)
- Unsolicited social mentions (brand awareness)
- Community-created content (organic evangelism)
- Streamers promoting without prompting (genuine value)

**Red Flags:**
- Streamers launch but don't promote (low engagement)
- High first trade rate but low repeat rate (retention issue)
- Volume concentrated in few tokens (demand problem)
- High referral signups but low conversion (poor targeting)
- Declining average token volume (market saturation)

### Pivot Triggers

**If by Day 30:**
- <20 active tokens → Streamer acquisition strategy failing (increase incentives or change targeting)
- <$200K volume → Trader demand insufficient (increase marketing or improve product)
- <20% D7 retention → Product not sticky (UX overhaul needed)

**If by Day 60:**
- Viral coefficient <0.5 → Growth unsustainable (double down on referral mechanics)
- Declining WoW growth → Market saturation or competition (expand TAM or differentiate)
- Negative unit economics → Pricing model broken (increase fees or reduce CAC)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Regulatory Uncertainty

**Risk:** Tokens classified as securities, platform shut down

**Mitigation:**
- Legal review before mainnet launch
- Terms of service clarity (trading at own risk)
- Geo-blocking if needed (US restrictions)
- Work with compliant partners (regulated exchanges)
- Build in kill-switch if needed

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Critical

---

### Risk 2: Scam Streamers

**Risk:** Streamers pump-and-dump their tokens, ruin reputation

**Mitigation:**
- KYC for streamers (prevent anonymity)
- Lock periods for streamer holdings (can't sell for 7 days)
- Platform monitoring (flag suspicious patterns)
- Community reporting (bounty for catching scams)
- Terms of service enforcement (ban scammers)

**Likelihood:** High | **Impact:** High

---

### Risk 3: Market Downturn

**Risk:** Crypto bear market kills speculative demand

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify narrative (not just speculation, but community tokens)
- Build during bear, scale in bull
- Focus on engaged communities (less price-sensitive)
- Pivot to utility (token-gated content, perks)

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

---

### Risk 4: Competition

**Risk:** Pump.fun or others launch streamer-focused product

**Mitigation:**
- Speed (ship fast, build moat through community)
- Focus (we're streamer-native, they're generic)
- Partnerships (lock in key platforms early)
- Network effects (once streamers are here, hard to leave)

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

---

### Risk 5: Platform Dependence

**Risk:** Twitch/Kick ban token promotion

**Mitigation:**
- Multi-platform strategy (YouTube, Rumble, independent)
- Subtle integration (don't violate ToS)
- Legal review of platform policies
- Build direct relationships (Discord, email)

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

---

Zeroglaze Launches: The First Platform Where Streamers Become Tradeable Tokens

[City, Date] - Zeroglaze, a new Solana-based platform, today announced its public launch, enabling content creators to launch their own tradeable tokens with bonding curve mechanics.

The platform addresses a critical gap in the streaming economy: while top streamers earn millions, 95% of streamers make less than minimum wage. Zeroglaze allows any streamer to monetize their community through tokenization.

"We're giving streamers the tools to become their own ticker symbols," said [Founder Name], CEO of Zeroglaze. "Fans can now invest in their favorite creators the same way they invest in memecoins."

In its beta phase, Zeroglaze facilitated $200,000 in trading volume across 30 streamer tokens, with early creators earning $500-2,000 per week in platform fees.

The platform features:
- One-click token launches for streamers
- Bonding curve pricing (inspired by pump.fun)
- Integrated trading interface
- Referral program (earn 0.1% of referrals' fees forever)

Zeroglaze is now open to all streamers and traders at zeroglaze.app.
