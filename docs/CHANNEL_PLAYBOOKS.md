### Thread Formats

**Thread Type 1: Success Story (7-10 tweets)**

```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
This 150-viewer streamer earned $2,400 in 5 days.

No sponsor. No partner program. Just Zeroglaze.

Here's the full story 🧵

Tweet 2 (Context):
@StreamerName streams Valorant 4x/week.
Average: 150 viewers
Discord: 400 members
Monthly subs: ~$300

Solid community, but struggling to monetize.

Tweet 3 (Discovery):
They found Zeroglaze through a Discord friend.

Concept: Launch a token, earn from trading volume.

Skeptical at first. "Sounds too good to be true."

But decided to try it.

Tweet 4 (Launch):
Tuesday night, 8 PM EST:
"Chat, we're doing something crazy tonight."

Launched $TICKER live on stream.
400 Discord members bought in first hour.

Starting market cap: $15K

Tweet 5 (Momentum):
Wednesday - Friday:
- Streamed 4 hours daily
- Token holders got exclusive emotes
- Held "token holder only" games
- Community went crazy

Market cap climbed: $15K → $120K

Tweet 6 (Results):
By Sunday:
- 800+ unique holders
- $240K total volume
- Token price up 8x from launch
- Creator earnings: $2,400 (1% of volume)

That's 8x their monthly sub income. In 5 days.

Tweet 7 (Secret Sauce):
What made it work:

1. Genuine community (not mercenary traders)
2. Daily streaming (consistent engagement)
3. Holder perks (VIP treatment)
4. Authenticity (didn't shill, just had fun)

Tweet 8 (Contrast):
Compare to traditional streaming:
- Twitch takes 50% of subs
- Sponsors demand huge audiences
- Donations are unpredictable
- No equity in your own brand

With Zeroglaze:
- You earn from every trade
- Small audience is enough
- Passive income continues
- You own your economy

Tweet 9 (Social Proof):
@StreamerName's reaction:

"I made more this week than my last 3 months combined. This is insane."

They're not special. You can do this too.

Tweet 10 (CTA):
Want to launch your own token?

First 100 streamers get:
- $50 SOL bonus
- 0% fees for 30 days
- 1-on-1 launch support

Apply: [link]

Or if you're a trader, browse 100+ tokens: [link]
```

**Thread Type 2: Educational (5-8 tweets)**

```
Tweet 1:
How bonding curves work on Zeroglaze.

A thread for traders who want to understand the mechanics 🧵

Tweet 2:
A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that determines price based on supply.

As more tokens are bought → price goes up
As tokens are sold → price goes down

No order books. No liquidity pools. Just math.

Tweet 3:
Our formula:
Price = Base × (Supply^2)

Example:
- Token 1: Price = $0.001
- Token 1000: Price = $1.00
- Token 10000: Price = $100

Early buyers get best price. Later buyers pay more.

Tweet 4:
Why this matters:

1. No rug pulls (liquidity is the curve itself)
2. Always liquid (you can always sell)
3. Predictable (you can calculate exact price)
4. Fair (everyone uses same curve)

Tweet 5:
Launch mechanics:

- Streamer creates token (costs ~$5)
- Initial supply: 1 billion tokens
- Streamer gets 10% (locked for 7 days to prevent dumps)
- 90% available for trading

Tweet 6:
Trading fees:
- 1% on every trade (buy or sell)
- 0.9% to platform
- 0.1% to creator

The more volume, the more creator earns.

Incentive alignment = creator wants active trading.

Tweet 7:
Graduation:

If token hits $1M market cap + $500K volume:
- Migrates to Raydium/Jupiter
- Lists on CEXs (if demand)
- Becomes "real" crypto asset

Only ~1% of tokens graduate. That's the 100x dream.

Tweet 8:
Questions? Ask below.

Want to try it yourself?
- Browse tokens: [link]
- Launch token: [link]

Trade with caution. This is highly speculative. DYOR.
```

### Engagement Strategy

**Reply Game (30 min/day):**

1. **Monitor mentions** (TweetDeck column)
   - Reply to every mention within 1 hour
   - Be helpful, not salesy
   - Use humor when appropriate

2. **Engage with Solana ecosystem**
   - Reply to @solana tweets
   - Engage with @phantom, @pumpdotfun, @jup_ag
   - Add value, don't spam

3. **Join trending conversations**
   - Search: "streaming" OR "twitch" OR "creator economy"
   - Reply with relevant Zeroglaze context
   - Example: "This is exactly why we built Zeroglaze..."

**Quote Tweet Strategy:**

Find viral tweets about:
- Streaming being underpaid
- Meme coins pumping
- Creator economy problems
- Solana ecosystem wins

Quote tweet with:
- Agreement + Zeroglaze solution
- Data point or case study
- Invitation to learn more

**Example:**
```
Original tweet: "I've been streaming for 2 years and make $200/month. This is unsustainable."

Quote tweet:
"This is heartbreaking and exactly why we built Zeroglaze.

We've had streamers with <200 viewers earn $500-2000/week through token trading.

Small audience ≠ small income anymore.

DM me if you want to learn how it works."
```

**Template (Tier 1 Streamers):**

```
Hey [Name]!

I caught your [specific recent stream moment] stream yesterday - that [specific thing] was hilarious/impressive/insane.

Quick question: Have you ever thought about launching your own token?

I built a platform (Zeroglaze) where streamers create tokens that trade like crypto. You stream, your community trades, you earn from every transaction.

Streamers with ~[their viewer count] viewers are making $500-2000/week on top of subs.

Would you be down for a quick 10-min call where I walk you through how it works?

No pressure - just think your community would love it.

[Your name]
Founder, Zeroglaze

P.S. First 100 streamers get $50 SOL bonus. You'd be #[current count].
```

**Template (Crypto-Curious Streamers):**

```
Hey [Name],

Saw you mention [crypto reference] on stream. Respect.

I'm building something at the intersection of streaming + Solana that I think you'd vibe with.

Basically: You launch a token. Your fans trade it. You earn passive income from volume.

Streamers your size are clearing $1K+/week. Some way more.

Want to see a quick demo? 10 min call, zero commitment.

[Your name]
```

**Template (Non-Crypto Streamers):**

```
Hey [Name],

Love your [content type] streams. Your community seems super engaged.

I built a new monetization method for streamers that doesn't rely on Twitch partner or sponsors.

You basically create a digital asset tied to your brand, and your fans can invest in you.

Early streamers (even small ones) are making $500-2000/week.

Mind if I send you a 2-min video explaining how it works?

### Outreach Metrics

**Daily Activity (Per Person):**
- Research: 30 streamers/hour = 15 min
- Outreach: 30 DMs/hour = 30 min
- Follow-ups: 20 DMs/hour = 15 min

| Actually launched | 8 | 80% of scheduled |

**Final conversion:** 8% contacted → launched

**To hit 200 streamers by Week 12:**

- Build playbook

**Week 5-8: Add VA/SDR (Tier 1 + Tier 2)**

- Scale to 100 contacts/day

**Week 9-12: Automated + Inbound (All Tiers)**
- Inbound applications from website
- Automated email sequences for warm leads
- Founder only handles Tier 1 calls
- VA handles Tier 2-3 calls
- Scale to 200 contacts/day

### Templates Library

**Discord Announcement Template (For Streamer to Post):**

```
Big announcement! 🚀

I just launched my own token on @Zeroglaze.

Here's the deal:
- Token: $[TICKER]
- You can buy/sell it like crypto
- I earn from every trade
- Token holders get [perks]

This is an experiment. Let's see what happens.

Trade: [link]

Not financial advice. Super speculative. Only invest what you're okay losing.

But if you've ever wanted to "invest" in me... now you can 😅

LFG! 💎
```

**Twitter Announcement Template:**

```
I did a thing. 👀

Just launched $[TICKER] on @zeroglaze.

My community can now trade me like a memecoin.

Cursed? Maybe.
Fun? Definitely.
Making money? Already. 💰

Try it: [link]

[Attach: Token chart showing early growth]
```

**On-Stream Script:**

```
"Alright chat, we're doing something weird today.

I launched a token. Like, an actual cryptocurrency token. It's called $[TICKER].

You can buy it, sell it, trade it like a memecoin. And I earn from every trade.

I know, I know, sounds like a scam. But here's the thing - it's on Solana, it's legit, and I'm not taking your money. You're trading with each other.

If you want to support the stream in a new way, check it out: [link]

If not, no worries. We're still streaming either way.

But honestly? This could be sick. Let's run it."
```

[Show Zeroglaze, streamer earnings]
```

Target: 10-20 duets/week

**2. Trend Hijacking**

Monitor trending:
- Sounds
- Challenges
- Formats

Adapt to Zeroglaze context:
```
Trending: "If I was in charge" format

Your version:
"If I was in charge of Twitch, I'd let streamers launch tokens and earn from trading volume.

Oh wait. I built that. It's called Zeroglaze."
```

**3. Collaboration**

Partner with:
- Micro-streamers (10K-100K followers)

- "How to stream" creators

Offer:

Reply style:
- Short and helpful
- Use humor
- Ask questions back (drives more replies)

**5. Cross-Promotion**

Every TikTok:
