Subject: Partnership opportunity - Zeroglaze x Phantom

Hey [Name],

I'm [Your name], founder of Zeroglaze. We're building the first platform where streamers launch tradeable tokens on Solana.

We launched 3 weeks ago and hit $500K volume with 50 active tokens. Streamers are earning $500-2K/week.

I think Phantom + Zeroglaze could unlock significant value:

FOR PHANTOM:
- More transactions (we're driving 1,000+ trades/day)
- New demographic (streamers + gamers, not typical crypto users)
- Mobile-first use case (trading while watching streams)

FOR ZEROGLAZE:
- Better UX (seamless wallet integration)
- Credibility (association with #1 Solana wallet)
- Distribution (featured in your dApp section)

I'd love to show you what we've built and explore partnership opportunities.

We're applying for a $75K grant to:
- Hire 2 engineers (scale faster)

I'd love to chat about how we can contribute to the Solana ecosystem.

## Streaming Platform Partnerships

### Priority Targets

**Tier 1 (Most Realistic):**
1. Kick (crypto-friendly, smaller, accessible)
2. Rumble (growing, less restrictive)

**Tier 2 (Longer-term):**
3. Twitch (largest, but strict policies)
4. YouTube Gaming (massive, but slow-moving)

---

### Partnership 4: Kick

**Why Partner:**
- Crypto-friendly (owned by Stake.com)
- Growing fast (competing with Twitch)
- Less restrictive policies
- Accessible to smaller players

**What We Want:**
1. Official integration (Zeroglaze in Kick streamer dashboard)
2. Co-marketing (feature us on Kick blog/socials)
3. Direct access to streamers (bulk outreach)
4. Revenue share (we pay % of fees for the partnership)

**What They Get:**
1. New monetization option for their streamers (competitive advantage)
2. Revenue share (passive income from our success)
3. Differentiation from Twitch (innovative features)
4. Crypto integration (aligns with their brand)

**Pitch Angle:**

"Kick is the crypto-native streaming platform. Zeroglaze is crypto-native monetization. Together, we give streamers what Twitch never will: true ownership of their economy."

**Outreach Plan:**

**Step 1: Build Case Study First**

- Get 10-20 Kick streamers on Zeroglaze organically
- Track their earnings
- Create detailed case study
- Use as proof for partnership pitch

**Step 2: Find Right Contact**

- Likely: Head of Creator Partnerships or BD
- LinkedIn search
- Twitter DMs
- Mutual connections (investors, advisors)

**Step 3: Pitch Email**

```
Subject: Partnership - New monetization for Kick streamers

Hey [Name],

I'm [Your name], founder of Zeroglaze. We've built a platform where streamers launch tradeable tokens on Solana.

We've quietly onboarded 20 Kick streamers. They're earning $500-2K/week on top of their Kick revenue.

I think Kick + Zeroglaze could be a killer combo:

FOR KICK:
- Differentiated monetization (Twitch doesn't have this)
- Attract more streamers ($ is the #1 reason they choose platforms)
- Revenue share (we split fees with you)
- Crypto-native (aligns with Stake/Kick ethos)

FOR ZEROGLAZE:
- Direct access to Kick's growing streamer base
- Integration in Kick dashboard
- Official partnership credibility
- Cross-marketing

We have 3 options for partnership structure:
1. Light: Co-marketing only
2. Medium: Integration + co-marketing
3. Full: Exclusive partnership, rev share, deep integration

I'd love to show you what 20 Kick streamers are already doing with us.

30 min call?

[Your name]
```

**Step 4: Demo Call**

- Show platform
- Show Kick streamers' earnings
- Walk through integration possibilities
- Discuss economics (rev share model)
- Get them excited about differentiating from Twitch

**Timeline:**
- Week 8: Onboard 20 Kick streamers organically
- Week 10: Compile case study
- Week 11: Reach out to Kick team
- Week 12-16: Negotiation + partnership planning
- Week 20+: Official launch

## Crypto Exchange Partnerships

### Priority Targets

**Tier 1 (Realistic):**
1. MEXC (Tier 2 CEX, easier listings)
2. Gate.io (Similar to MEXC)

**Tier 2 (Aspirational):**
3. Coinbase (Tier 1, high bar)
4. Binance (Tier 1, extremely high bar)

---

### Partnership 5: MEXC

**Why Partner:**
- Token graduation path (successful tokens list on CEX)
- Credibility (real exchange listing)
- Liquidity (more traders, more volume)
- Marketing (MEXC promotes new listings)

**What We Want:**
1. Bulk listing deal (10 tokens for price of 3)
2. Reduced listing fees ($10K per token vs. $50K standard)
3. Co-marketing for graduated tokens
4. Fast-track listing process

**What They Get:**
1. New token pipeline (we deliver pre-vetted, high-volume tokens)
2. Unique vertical (streamer tokens = new category)
3. Engaged communities (streamer fans = loyal traders)
4. PR (innovative use case)

**Partnership Structure:**

**Option A: Pay-per-listing**
- $10K per token
- Only list tokens that hit $1M mcap + $500K volume
- Expected: 1-2 tokens/month

**Option B: Revenue share**
- No upfront fee
- MEXC gets 0.2% of our platform fees from graduated tokens
- Ongoing passive income for them

**Option C: Bulk deal**
- $30K for first 5 tokens
- $5K per token after that
- Volume discount

**Outreach Template:**

```
Subject: Token listing partnership - Streamer tokens from Zeroglaze

Hey [MEXC BD team],

We're Zeroglaze - a Solana platform where streamers launch tokens. We're doing $500K weekly volume with 50+ tokens.

Here's the opportunity:

We have a graduation path for successful tokens:
- When token hits $1M mcap + $500K volume → graduates
- We migrate to DEX (Jupiter/Raydium)
- Next step: CEX listing

PROPOSAL:
List our graduated tokens on MEXC with a bulk deal structure.

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Pre-vetted tokens (already proven demand)
- Built-in communities (streamers bring their fans)
- New vertical (streamer tokens = unique category)
- Pipeline (1-2 tokens/month graduating)

We're in talks with Gate.io as well, but prefer MEXC.

Can we discuss a partnership?

[Your name]
```

**Timeline:**
- Week 12: First token graduates (hopefully)
- Week 13: Reach out to MEXC
- Week 14-16: Negotiate deal
- Week 18: First listing
- Ongoing: Regular listings

## Partnership Metrics

### Track Performance

For each partnership, measure:

**Awareness:**
- Impressions from co-marketing
- Brand mentions
- Traffic from partner

**Acquisition:**
- Signups attributed to partner
- Wallet connections
- First trades

**Activation:**
- Conversion rates from partner traffic
- Quality of users (LTV)

**Economic:**
- Cost of partnership (money, time, resources)
- Revenue generated
- ROI

**Example Tracking:**

```
Partnership: Influencer X
Type: Paid promotion
Cost: $2,000 + 0.2% rev share
Duration: Week 9

Results (30 days):
- Impressions: 150,000
- Link clicks: 2,300
- Signups: 184
- First trades: 73
- Volume generated: $47,000
- Our fees: $470
- Rev share paid: $94
- Total cost: $2,094
- ROI: -77% (lost money upfront)

BUT:
- 30-day LTV per user: $8
- If they stay 12 months: $32
- Total LTV: 184 × $32 = $5,888
- Long-term ROI: +181%

Decision: Worth it long-term. Do more influencer deals.
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Start with small, low-risk partnerships
- Always track attribution (UTM codes, referral links)
- Be transparent about goals and expectations
- Deliver on commitments (build reputation)
- Nurture relationships (not transactional)
- Think long-term (partnerships compound)

### DON'T:
- Over-promise and under-deliver
- Hide important information
- Demand exclusivity unless you're paying for it
- Ignore partners after deal closes
- Burn bridges (crypto is small)
- Partner with scammy projects (kills your credibility)

---

**End of Partnership Strategy Document**

**Key Takeaway:**
Partnerships are a force multiplier. One good partnership can 10x your growth. But they take time to build. Start planting seeds now, harvest in 3-6 months.
